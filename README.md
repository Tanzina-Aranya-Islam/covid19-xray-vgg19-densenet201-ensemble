# covid19-xray-vgg19-densenet201-ensemble
This project classifies chest X-ray images into four classes—COVID-19, Lung Opacity, Normal, and Viral Pneumonia—using VGG19, DenseNet201, and an ensemble model. Images were preprocessed using bilateral filtering and CLAHE to improve quality and enhance model performance.
